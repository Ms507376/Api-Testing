Q #1). What are web services?
       Web services are web components that transfer data between client and server.The client sends a web request to the server and the server then

       WSDL stands for Web Service Description Language and is a document written in XML. It uses XML to define the service layer document which consists of
       origin of the web service, headers, port types, request and response data. This one can provide the information about web methods and web service.
       It describes:
        Origin of the web service

        Port type
        Input and output messages
       
       
  Q #4) . What is the role of WSDL document in web service testing?
          Validating web services in only possible with WSDL document because to configure web services in SoapUI, WSDL document is mandatory.
          If the WSDL document is not valid, SoapUI will throw an exception immediately.
