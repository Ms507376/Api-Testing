Q #1). What are web services?
       Web services are web components that transfer data between client and server.The client sends a web request to the server and the server then
       responds to the client.Web Service is a web component or software program that can be accessed on the Internet. It is mainly used to communicate
       with the web-based applications through XML messaging concepts.
       E.g  If we want to access a particular location using Google Maps,we can use the corresponding web service URL.
       
 Q #2). What is the primary challenge when testing web services?
        Majority of the functional testing is carried out via the GUI, the biggest challenge of web services is that they do not have a UI.
        
 Q #3). What is WSDL?
        WSDL stands for Web Service Description Language and is a document written in XML. It uses XML to define the service layer document which consists of
        origin of the web service, headers, port types, request and response data. This one can provide the information about web methods and web service.
        It describes:
        Origin of the web service
        Header information
        Port type
        Input and output messages
       
       
  Q #4) . What is the role of WSDL document in web service testing?
          Validating web services in only possible with WSDL document because to configure web services in SoapUI, WSDL document is mandatory.
          If the WSDL document is not valid, SoapUI will throw an exception immediately.
          
  Q #5) . What would be the message format of SOAP protocol?
          <?xml version=”1.0??>
          <soap:Envelope xmlns:soap=”http://www.example.com/soap-envelope”>
          <soap:Header>
          </soap:Header>
          <soap:Body>
         <m:TutorialName>SoapUI</m:TutorialName>
         </soap:Body>
         </soap:Envelope>
         
         
   Q #6). What are the advantages of SOAP?
          Since its XML based, it is platform and programming language independent.
          
   Q #7).  What does a soap document contain?
           Envelope element is the topmost tag which identifies the XML document as a SOAP message.
           Header element that has header information. 
           The Body element specifies the call and response information.
           Fault element which contains errors and status information.
